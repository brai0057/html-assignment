    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a student at Algonquin College, learning web development and design. I enjoy working on creative projects mainly things like video editing or photoshop. I am especially interested in video editing as editing things like music videos always seemed cool to me and gives alot of freedom to make what you want. This is my 1<sup>st</sup> year of exploring digital tools, and I am excited for what’s next.

      Outside of school, I enjoy playing games and editing videos. I believe learning never stops, and I spend time improving my skills. I want to help people make music videos for thier songs.
